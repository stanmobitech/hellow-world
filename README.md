#How Pgramming Chose Stan
I had been very actively involved in multiple investments of time but with money as the main focus. 
Soon I realized that life was not all about money and that the world needed change.
Networking with individuals increased and hence challenged to do something unique.
Friends graduated and I defered leaving me with no option than to prove that I was on the right path.
Where can I learn to code, how do I start, who will finance me, which language should I begine with?
All this questions required my attention or else, all my nights were sleepless.
JAVA, the language that begun as Oack and then named after the amounts of coffee taken during its development stages interested me.
I joined codeacademy today as of 8th October, 2017 and discovered that I last coded in 2013 and knew that I am old and need to reclaim my place like a professional.
Did Introduction to Java and scored 8/8 of the questions asked, 12/12 of the code challenges, 100% of the grading and 3 bages. Then I linked the account to all my social media and GitHub as well. 
Repository introduced me to you and thanks that you are reading.
